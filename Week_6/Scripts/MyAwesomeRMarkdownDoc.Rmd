# Introduction
Today we are going to work with the penguin data to learn *RMarkdown*.

## Load Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(here)
```

# Inspect the data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
glimpse(penguins)
```

# Make a plot
This is a plot of penguins of bill length and bill depth. **Species** are in colors.  
Species:  
- Gentoo  
- Adelie  
- Chinstrap  

```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm,
             y = bill_depth_mm,
             color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + #linear model
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)") +
  theme_bw()
```
